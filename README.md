# swift-algorithms-data-structures

Here is the start of a collection of algorithms/data structures that I wish to reimplement in Swift to stay in shape.<br/>
I learned fundamental algorithms at Princeton University with Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne's 
[Algorithms 4th Ed.](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/52trie/TST.java.html)

If you find any mistakes with my code or have better implementations, please let me know! I have much to learn.
